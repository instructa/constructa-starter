# Main Project Rules

- Always get recommendation and best practice considering latest NOW date

- Never use `npx shadcn-ui@latest`! Always use `npx shadcn@latest`.
- Always use pnpm as the package manager.
- All route files must be written in **TypeScript React** (`.tsx`).
- Use alias imports: `@` resolves to root `./`.
- Don't use default exports in route files.
