# Route File Rule

- All route files must be TypeScript React (`.tsx`).
- Export exactly one named constant `Route` per file. No default exports.
- Use `createFileRoute('/path')` or `createRootRoute` for route definitions. The path must match the file structure.
- Place the main component after the `Route` export, named `<FileName>Component`.
- If a loader is needed, use an async `loader` function and destructure params directly.
- Always check `res.ok` after fetches in loaders; throw on failure.
- Use `Route.useLoaderData()` for typed data access.
- For error handling, add `errorComponent` and/or `notFoundComponent` as needed.
- Use the typed `<Link>` from `@tanstack/react-router` for navigation, with proper `to`, `params`, and styling.
- Use alias imports: `@` resolves to root `./`.
- Do not use default exports in route files.
