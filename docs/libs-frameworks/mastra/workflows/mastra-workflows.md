Workflows overview
Workflows let you define and orchestrate complex sequences of tasks as typed steps connected by data flows. Each step has clearly defined inputs and outputs validated by Zod schemas.

A workflow manages execution order, dependencies, branching, parallelism, and error handling â€” enabling you to build robust, reusable processes. Steps can be nested or cloned to compose larger workflows.

Workflows overview

You create workflows by:

Defining steps with createStep, specifying input/output schemas and business logic.
Composing steps with createWorkflow to define the execution flow.
Running workflows to execute the entire sequence, with built-in support for suspension, resumption, and streaming results.
This structure provides full type safety and runtime validation, ensuring data integrity across the entire workflow.

Getting started
To use workflows, install the required dependencies:

npm install @mastra/core
Import the necessary functions from the workflows subpath:

src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts

import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
Create step
Steps are the building blocks of workflows. Create a step using createStep:

src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts

const step1 = createStep({...});
See createStep for more information.

Create workflow
Create a workflow using createWorkflow and complete it with .commit().

src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts

import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
 
const step1 = createStep({...});
 
export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
See workflow for more information.

Composing steps
Workflow steps can be composed and executed sequentially using .then().

src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts

import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
 
const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});
 
export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
Steps can be composed using a number of different methods. See Control Flow for more information.

Cloning steps
Workflow steps can be cloned using cloneStep(), and used with any workflow method.

src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts

import { createWorkflow, createStep, cloneStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
 
const step1 = createStep({...});
const clonedStep = cloneStep(step1, { id: "cloned-step" });
const step2 = createStep({...});
 
export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(clonedStep)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
Register workflow
Register a workflow using workflows in the main Mastra instance:

src/mastra/index.ts

import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
 
import { testWorkflow } from "./workflows/test-workflow";
 
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: { testWorkflow },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    // stores telemetry, evals, ... into memory storage, if it needs to persist, change to file:../mastra.db
    url: ":memory:"
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info"
  })
});
Testing workflows locally
There are two ways to run and test workflows.

Mastra Playground
With the Mastra Dev Server running you can run the workflow from the Mastra Playground by visiting http://localhost:4111/workflows  in your browser.

For more information, see the Local Dev Playground documentation.

Command line
Create a workflow run instance using createRunAsync and start:

src/test-workflow.ts

import "dotenv/config";
 
import { mastra } from "./mastra";
 
const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();
 
const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});
 
console.log(result);
 
if (result.status === 'success') {
  console.log(result.result.output);
}
see createRunAsync and start for more information.

To trigger this workflow, run the following:


npx tsx src/test-workflow.ts
Run workflow results
The result of running a workflow using either start() or resume() will look like one of the following, depending on the outcome.

Status success
{
  "status": "success",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "success",
    }
  },
  "result": {
    "output": "London + step-1"
  }
}
status: Shows the final state of the workflow execution, either: success, suspended, or error
steps: Lists each step in the workflow, including inputs and outputs
status: Shows the outcome of each individual step
result: Includes the final output of the workflow, typed according to the outputSchema
Status suspended
{
  "status": "suspended",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "suspended",
    }
  },
  "suspended": [
    [
      "step-1"
    ]
  ]
}
suspended: An optional array listing any steps currently awaiting input before continuing
Status failed
{
  "status": "failed",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "failed",
      "error": "Test error",
    }
  },
  "error": "Test error"
}
error: An optional field that includes the error message if the workflow fails
Stream workflow
Similar to the run method shown above, workflows can also be streamed:

src/test-workflow.ts

import { mastra } from "./mastra";
 
const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();
 
const result = await run.stream({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});
 
for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
See stream for more information.

Watch Workflow
A workflow can also be watched, allowing you to inspect each event that is emitted.

src/test-workflow.ts

import { mastra } from "./mastra";
 
const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();
 
run.watch((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
 
const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});
