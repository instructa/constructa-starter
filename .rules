# Main Project Rules

- Always get recommendation and best practice considering latest NOW date
- Never use `npx shadcn-ui@latest`! Always use `npx shadcn@latest`.
- Always use pnpm as the package manager.
- All route files must be written in **TypeScript React** (`.tsx`).
- Use alias imports: `~` resolves to root `./src`.
- Don't use default exports in route files.
- If a file might ever ship to the browser, read env vars with import.meta.env
- Never update .env file, update the .env.example instead
